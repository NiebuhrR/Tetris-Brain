/**
A simple Brain implementation.
bestMove() iterates through all the possible x values
and rotations to play a particular piece (there are only
around 10-30 ways to play a piece).

For each play, it uses the rateBoard() message to rate how
good the resulting board is and it just remembers the
play with the lowest score. Undo() is used to back-out
each play before trying the next. To experiment with writing your own
brain -- just subclass off LameBrain and override rateBoard().
